DX-WP-HTML-Inspector
====================

WordPress plugin wrapper for the [HTML Inspector](https://github.com/philipwalton/html-inspector) library. Install the plugin and activate it - it would automatically be fired on all frontend pages, check your JavaScript console for more details.

All the heavy lifting happens through the HTML Inspector library. Check the [Writing Your Own Rules](https://github.com/philipwalton/html-inspector#writing-your-own-rules) section if you are interested in getting involved with the project or setting your own validation rules.
